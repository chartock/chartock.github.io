			<p>For the month of August before classes begin in Philadelphia, new Wharton PhDs take math camp. My math camp is taught by a 3rd year doctoral student in OID (operations, information, and decisions). We are learning about the real numbers (the set of all rational numbers and irrational numbers) and about Euclidian spaces in R^n. We are writing the proofs for convergent sequences and limits, boundedness, and monotonicity. We are learning about Cauchy sequences. </p>

			<p>Math camp seems to be leading us towards understanding maximization under constraint, which I see useful for both consumer & producer theory (e.g., minimize cost, maximize utility) and for econometrics (e.g., minimize the error of a best-fit line). These are cool concepts. The math camp has us doing a lot of proofs.</p>

			<p>In the morning I take Tech Camp, where I learn coding including the skills to set up this website. I move into my apartment this weekend; I'm very excited.</p>
