               <h2> Unusual Health Needs of Different States</h2>

			<p>Today's New York Times features an article describing the <em>unique</em> travel locations of each US State. It's not the most popular travel locations (overwhelmingly Canada & Mexico) but rather which countries outside of the US that the state in question has particularly more traveling connections to <em>reative to the national levels</em>.  </p>

      <p>This got me thinking about the different health needs of disperse populations in the United States. You see, the reason a state has an above-average level of travelers to a particular country relates to that state's immigrant population. In particular, when a new family or individual choses to immigrate to the US, they will likely chose a place where they have family or connections (for cultural and financial reasons). Take a look at the map below. The most frequent "unusual" travel destination from Maryland is El Salvador. When I lived in Washington, DC (near the Maryland border), I noticed huge communities of Salvadorian immigrants, and large families and neighborhood gatherings were common. It comes as no surprise to me that El Salvador is the most "unique" destination (borrowing that word from the authors of the article). This concept can be called "Anchor immigration". Check out the map, below, which illustrates anchor immigration across the country. </p>

			<p>This figure got me thinking about disparities of health needs across the United States. Disparate needs reflect the myriad of communities in the United States. <em>Health Affairs</em> even dedicated their August 2016 issue to the many factors that effect care disparities. The map above can remind us why, for instance, some states have higher cost diabetes care, while others might see low-cost emergency care. Many factors contribute to price variation for care, but understanding the communities that hospitals and doctors serve is certainly a major component.</p>

      <p>The authors of the article do a good job taking interesting data and presenting it. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/03/sunday-review/summer-vacation-travel-destinations.html?action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=opinion-c-col-right-region&region=opinion-c-col-right-region&WT.nav=opinion-c-col-right-region" >Here</a> is a link to the NYTimes article. Authors are Stuart A. Thompson and Jessia Ma. Kudos, and welcome to my blog.
